# Stop eating fish, you are taking part in helping bad people invest in a business where sealife, nature and people are being killed!

## The list of facts along with references to these facts are listed down below!

1. ### Whales, sharks and many other creatures from the sea are dying at an alarming rate, most are close to extinction!

2. ### Sealife that go extinct will cause the eventual death of existing oceans, and then it **WILL** lead to our own death!
    > *"People should not be afraid of having sharks, they should be afraid of not having sharks in the oceans. The sharks keep our oceans healthy, they keep fish stocks healthy, they keep the ecosystems alive, they keep our coral reefs alive. If we don't have these sharks, if these sharks get finned into extinction then the ocean is going to turn into a swamp and guess whose gonna die next? Us."* (de Gelder, 2021: Seaspiracy)

3. ### Other animals become endangered due to fishing, legal/illegal, turtles are a great example because many species of turtles face extinction!
    This will increase the rate of oceans being severly harmed. 
4. ### Many observers, people who watch if **ILLEGAL** fishing is being carried out, are not only being bribed, they are being killed if they don't take the bribe!

5. ### The same organizations that are behind fishing carry out other crimes like drug trafficking, human trafficking and a lot of other crimes. 
    > *"When we look at fisheries crimes we have to look at it within the contexct of transnational organized crime, and the same syndicates that are behind illegal fishing are the same criminal groups that are behind drug trafficking, human trafficking and other crimes."* (Hammarstedt, 2021: Seaspiracy) 
6. ### Tax payer money is being used to invest in fishing. 
    > *"So if you think about it, it's really shocking that we subsidize the fishing industry, somewhere in the region of $35,000,000,000, which is the same amount that, according to the United Nations, we'd need to combat world hunger." (Hicks, 2021: Seaspiracy) 
7. ### Fishing operations also cause other economies to be destroyed!

8. ### People, of all ages, are being enslaved to do forced labor, the death rate is more than U.S. troops dying over seas!
